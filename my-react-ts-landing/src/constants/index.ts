        text: `Evolve is on a mission to redefine vacation rental management. We focus on the complex task of marketing and booking your home, and give you the flexibility to configure on-site home services to your liking.
               Most companies will charge 30-50% of your rental income in exchange for providing you with a “full-service” management solution. The average vacation rental management company typically lacks the resources and expertise to promote your property effectively. They also charge exorbitant commissions for on-site home services that have nothing to do with convincing travelers to book your rental. We boast an industry-low management fee of just 10%.`

                • Our in-house team of Travel Advisors will handle guest questions and respond quickly to every inquiry 7 days a week, even on nights and weekends.

                • Get world-class support from real people. We handle all pre-and post-stay communication with your guests and on-site partners, and our team is always just a phone call away.

                • You’ll get a full range of options for managing on-site home services, including self-service, continuing to work with the people you already know and trust, or working with one of our vetted local partners.

                • Every booking is also protected by our industry-leading Property Protection Plus program with up to $3,000 in damage protection and $1,000,000 in liability coverage.

                • Best of all, there’s no long-term commitment and no hidden fees!`

            Evolve offers the most flexible management solution in the industry, but there are a few things we’re sticklers about:

            • Your rental must meet Evolve’s 4 Core Property Standards, which are that every guest should arrive at a Safe, Clean, Guest Ready, and As Advertised property.

            • Your Evolve calendar must be kept up to date at all times to avoid the potential for double bookings.

            • You must have approval from your city and (if applicable) homeowners’ association to operate your property as a short-term rental.`

            We have an unprecedentedly low 10% management fee, which is only charged when we secure a reservation on your vacation rental property. And there’s no long-term commitment to a contract period.

            Evolve’s commission-based pricing structure means we only make money when you make money, which keeps us 100% motivated to maximize your rental income. Our owners don’t stick with us because they have to finish out a contract—they stay because they love the service they receive and the rental income they’re making as an Evolve owner.`

                If you need help finding a reliable local partner, our ever-expanding partner network can help you with guest check-ins, housekeeping, maintenance, and more. Better yet, all of our partners are fixed-fee-based, so you’ll never get stuck paying excessive commissions for on-site home services.`
